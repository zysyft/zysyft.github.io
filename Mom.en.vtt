00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:07.354
Good morning, guys.
- Good morning, ma'am.

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:09.918
Good morning.

00:03:12.663 --> 00:03:15.437
Early morning... First class.

00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.063
And that too biology...

00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:22.437
Very sad, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:24.938
But what to do?
Studies are important.

00:03:25.117 --> 00:03:27.312
Waking up at 6:00 in the morning
should be of some use.

00:03:27.814 --> 00:03:29.063
Isn't it?
- Yes.

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:32.854
By the way, did you catch
the Sci-Fi film 'Space Bound'?

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:34.938
Yes, ma'am. What a movie!

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:36.896
Is it a good movie?

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.868
Have you seen it?
- I think I've seen the trailer.

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:40.188
Why don't you go with him?

00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:41.317
Why should I go with him?

00:03:41.437 --> 00:03:43.134
Are you blushing?
- You all should really watch it.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:44.271
It's a nice movie.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:47.771
Today, we'll study the different
muscle groups in the human body.

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:50.561
There are 639 muscles
in the human body,

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.473
and each has a unique function.

00:03:53.073 --> 00:03:54.723
Let's start with this portion here.

00:03:55.263 --> 00:03:59.765
Rectus abdominis, also known as...

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:07.431
Popularly known as the 'six-packs'.

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:09.890
What's this?
- Hello, guys.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.056
It is still a biology class.
So concentrate.

00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:17.890
The function of rectus abdominis
is flexing at the abdomen.

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:20.957
It runs vertically
across the stomach

00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:24.306
and is separated from the skin
by a layer of fat and water.

00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:25.306
You're a pervert.

00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:27.306
This is called the transverse
abdominis. - What's the matter?

00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:29.645
Look what he has sent.
- And these here are the oblique.

00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:31.223
Eww!
- They are...

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.263
What's going on?

00:04:35.723 --> 00:04:36.639
Nothing, ma'am.

00:04:39.238 --> 00:04:40.598
What happened here?

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.556
Nothing, ma'am.

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:46.681
You both leave the class now.

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:50.473
Ma'am, it's not our fault.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.514
Look what Mohit sent to Arya.

00:04:53.098 --> 00:04:55.098
Don't you know phones are
prohibited inside the class?

00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.817
Give me your phone.

00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:21.056
I am sorry, ma'am.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.681
Give me your phone!

00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:25.056
I won't do it again.
I swear it was the last time.

00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:26.389
I won't repeat myself.

00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:46.143
Tell your parents to come
and meet me.

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:47.347
Now back to class.

00:05:58.098 --> 00:05:59.639
Is my black suit
back from the dry cleaners?

00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.765
Yes, it's in the cupboard.

00:06:01.885 --> 00:06:02.853
Arya is coming.

00:06:02.973 --> 00:06:04.514
Okay, you sit here.

00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:11.806
What's in your hand, ma'am?

00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:14.018
It's nothing, ma'am.

00:06:14.138 --> 00:06:16.263
There's definitely something.

00:06:17.097 --> 00:06:18.811
Chocolates?
Your sister gave you, didn't she?

00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:20.806
How did you know, mom?

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:24.182
Your mom has 10 eyes.

00:06:24.432 --> 00:06:25.973
She can see everything.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.681
Even I can't hide
anything from her.

00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:30.519
Show me your 10 eyes.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.227
Show me.
- No, it's a secret.

00:06:32.347 --> 00:06:33.931
Show me.
- No, I won't.

00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:36.056
Hello, my dear. How was your day?

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:37.431
Ask her.

00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:41.144
Paneer...
- It's alright.

00:06:41.264 --> 00:06:42.223
I'll take it myself.

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:45.973
Anand, children's vacations
are round the corner.

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:48.140
Let's decide where to go.

00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:51.140
We'll need time for tickets
and hotel bookings.

00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:53.389
Last minute everything
becomes very expensive.

00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:54.848
Dad, shall I tell you
where we should go?

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:56.056
Where?

00:06:56.306 --> 00:06:57.806
See.
- Wow!

00:06:58.263 --> 00:06:59.514
Beautiful. Have a look.

00:07:02.182 --> 00:07:03.353
It's beautiful.
- Show me.

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:04.728
Where's this place?

00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:05.890
It's close to Kufri.

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:09.015
Okay, we'll plan once I'm back.

00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:12.556
Devki, please handle the bookings.
- Sure.

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:14.182
Dad, I've figured out everything.

00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:16.140
I'll tell you everything
when you're back.

00:07:17.175 --> 00:07:19.056
Dad, for how many days
are you going?

00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:20.556
For 10 days.

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:23.263
What do you want me to get
from New York?

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:25.140
Eiffel Tower!

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.478
The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:31.263
Then go to Paris,
why are you going to New York?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.223
By the way, dad, you're looking
very handsome today.

00:07:36.182 --> 00:07:37.263
What do you want?

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:40.514
She's just praising you.

00:07:41.124 --> 00:07:43.186
Last time she complimented me,

00:07:43.306 --> 00:07:45.431
I had to buy a phone
worth Rs 40,000.

00:07:45.963 --> 00:07:47.223
Tell me what you want.

00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:51.389
There's a party on Saturday night.
All my friends are going.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.639
Do you know about this?

00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:58.182
Saturday is Valentine's Day, right?

00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:00.431
So?
- Nothing.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.264
Where's the party?

00:08:02.804 --> 00:08:03.700
Dad, can I go?

00:08:04.013 --> 00:08:05.848
Tell me where the party is.

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:08.431
Zodiac Farms,
it's not far from here.

00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:11.765
That's very far.

00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:14.182
It's very far.

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:17.639
Who else is going?
- I told you, all my friends.

00:08:17.973 --> 00:08:19.848
Is Sapna going?
- Yes.

00:08:20.424 --> 00:08:21.556
And Rishi?
- Yes.

00:08:21.848 --> 00:08:23.556
Ma'am, how many more
questions will you ask?

00:08:24.223 --> 00:08:25.645
Arya...
- What?

00:08:25.765 --> 00:08:27.306
I am asking for your permission.

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:28.853
Okay, we'll think about it.

00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:32.103
What's there to think?
Don't you trust me?

00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:33.806
Of course, dear, we trust you.

00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:36.263
Then? Do you need ma'am's approval?

00:08:36.765 --> 00:08:38.890
Arya, behave yourself!

00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:42.389
Arya?

00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:01.723
'It's the hottest party in Delhi.'

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:03.974
'Kabir's coming as well.'

00:09:04.094 --> 00:09:05.765
'Listen, you should propose him.'

00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:08.056
Have you lost your mind? I mean...

00:09:09.057 --> 00:09:10.311
I'll talk to you later.

00:09:10.431 --> 00:09:11.723
'Bye.'

00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:16.431
Dinner.

00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:21.264
I spoke to your dad.

00:09:22.223 --> 00:09:23.223
He has agreed.

00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:26.015
You can go to the party.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.514
What are you going to wear?

00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:36.556
Never stay hungry
when you're angry.

00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:39.182
Eat your dinner.

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:44.056
Goodnight, dear.

00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:13.514
I don't feel like leaving you guys.

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:17.306
What do you think?

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:20.890
Arya was right.

00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:23.431
You're really looking handsome
these days.

00:10:24.628 --> 00:10:25.973
Really?
- Yes.

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.394
What do you want?

00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:30.723
Okay.

00:10:32.182 --> 00:10:36.389
Just finish your conference
and come back soon.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:44.056
I know you always
handle everything.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.639
But I'll try talking to Arya again.

00:10:50.678 --> 00:10:54.431
She just can't share you
with anyone.

00:10:56.347 --> 00:10:57.931
We need not make her understand.

00:10:58.473 --> 00:11:00.440
Instead, we should try
and understand her.

00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:06.848
Narendra, look after the house.

00:11:07.109 --> 00:11:08.723
Yes, sir.
- Dad.

00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:14.645
Why didn't you text
your shopping list yet?

00:11:14.765 --> 00:11:16.056
Don't you want anything?

00:11:17.308 --> 00:11:18.514
Dad...

00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:22.681
Dad, I am sorry for last night.

00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:27.306
I know I hurt you and ma'am.

00:11:28.502 --> 00:11:30.056
When will you stop
calling her that?

00:11:30.431 --> 00:11:31.973
She's your mom.

00:11:37.356 --> 00:11:38.973
You've forgotten my mother,

00:11:39.973 --> 00:11:41.556
but I can't.

00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:46.473
Dear, I did what I felt
was right for us.

00:11:47.535 --> 00:11:49.848
I could've never raised you
without Devki's help.

00:11:50.647 --> 00:11:52.431
She has accepted us both.

00:11:53.844 --> 00:11:55.765
She never differentiated
between you and Priya.

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.931
I have accepted Piyu.

00:12:01.683 --> 00:12:03.556
It's always the mother
who's blessed with a daughter.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.015
And not the other way around.

00:12:09.223 --> 00:12:10.681
I can't do it, dad.

00:12:11.842 --> 00:12:13.765
I can't let her down.

00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:17.347
I miss her.

00:12:18.598 --> 00:12:20.263
I really miss her.
- My baby...

00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:30.973
Go and enjoy your party.

00:12:31.598 --> 00:12:33.556
Dad!
- Hey...

00:12:35.306 --> 00:12:36.556
Anand.
- Yes?

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:40.223
Your laptop would be useless
without this.

00:12:41.306 --> 00:12:43.182
Oh my, God, where's my passport?

00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:45.306
Your passport and tickets
are in the right zip.

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:46.723
Right zip.

00:12:46.843 --> 00:12:48.473
What will I do without you?

00:12:48.863 --> 00:12:50.848
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

00:12:52.723 --> 00:12:54.098
Bye.
- Bye.

00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:03.723
Come soon.
- I will.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.103
Bye.
- Bye.

00:13:06.223 --> 00:13:07.098
Bye.

00:13:16.973 --> 00:13:18.890
Mina, answer the door.
- Yes.

00:13:19.973 --> 00:13:22.263
Is Devki at home?
We're her students.

00:13:22.473 --> 00:13:24.639
Ma'am, your students are here.

00:13:24.765 --> 00:13:26.263
Fine, I'll be right there.

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:28.645
Hello, ma'am.

00:13:28.765 --> 00:13:31.140
Niranjana, what brings you here?

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.098
Hello, ma'am.
- Hello. Come in.

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:35.556
Have a seat.

00:13:38.263 --> 00:13:41.015
We have started a new business,
tie and dye.

00:13:41.847 --> 00:13:44.890
We're here to give you
this sweet box.

00:13:45.347 --> 00:13:47.473
That's wonderful. Very good.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.973
This was not possible without you.

00:13:50.347 --> 00:13:53.263
You educated us... Gave us respect.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.765
It is because of that,
we've become self-independent.

00:13:56.146 --> 00:13:58.806
No, it's all because
of your hard work.

00:13:59.098 --> 00:14:01.848
Is that your elder daughter
you always talk about?

00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:05.559
Yes.
- Nice.

00:14:05.964 --> 00:14:09.473
Will you have tea or juice?
- No, we're running late.

00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:13.973
See you on Thursday.
Keep your assignments ready.

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.973
Arya, have some sweets.

00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:22.223
What do you talk to them about me?

00:14:22.973 --> 00:14:27.056
Nothing. Just like that...
Nice things only.

00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:30.306
I've no objection
to your social service.

00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:34.056
But you don't have
to talk to anyone about me.

00:14:36.702 --> 00:14:38.182
Didn't you tell them?

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.347
What?

00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:42.415
That I am not your daughter, ma'am?

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.765
Sweets.

00:15:16.931 --> 00:15:18.347
What are you doing, Piyu?

00:15:19.514 --> 00:15:21.681
Stop.

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:24.848
Finish it soon, it's too late.

00:15:25.347 --> 00:15:27.095
Just one more line to go.

00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:29.140
My sweet kid.

00:15:33.264 --> 00:15:34.973
Hi, Kabir.

00:15:51.848 --> 00:15:54.140
Don't be too late, please.

00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:55.723
Yes, ma'am...
- Yes, ma'am, don't worry.

00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:57.263
And Rishi, I hope your driver is...

00:15:57.431 --> 00:15:58.556
Arya...

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:02.264
You're looking so pretty.

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:04.890
Thanks. Bye.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.020
Isn't she, Piyu?
- Yes.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.306
Wait, dear...

00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:09.056
Arya, is your phone charged?

00:16:09.608 --> 00:16:10.478
Yes.

00:16:10.598 --> 00:16:12.306
Take care. Have fun.

00:16:12.765 --> 00:16:16.020
"All my life I have
been trying to run."

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.806
"Now I can see...
Now I can breathe."

00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:24.389
"All the time I had,
I just faded away."

00:16:26.973 --> 00:16:30.056
"All this time I was scared to be."

00:16:30.263 --> 00:16:34.186
"But now I am just me,
and I won't leave." - Cheers!

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:39.056
"No, I can't go back.
I am just flying free."

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.347
"People do what they want,"

00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:45.723
"when they want to do it.
Don't you understand?"

00:16:47.056 --> 00:16:49.263
"So, I am going to do what I like."

00:16:49.598 --> 00:16:53.182
"Take a chance.
This may never come again."

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.770
One more beer, dude.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.223
Charles!

00:17:00.648 --> 00:17:02.182
Charles!
- Yes?

00:17:02.473 --> 00:17:04.182
Remember I told you about
the girl I like.

00:17:05.431 --> 00:17:07.431
The same girl
whose mother broke your phone?

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:08.973
Yes.

00:17:10.182 --> 00:17:11.264
That's her, in the red outfit.

00:17:18.556 --> 00:17:20.431
Then why are you
wasting your time here?

00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:23.223
Should I go?
- Go.

00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:29.015
My bag.
- Come on.

00:17:33.849 --> 00:17:36.931
"It's my life."

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.765
"It's my life."

00:17:40.848 --> 00:17:46.848
"I'll live it the way I want."

00:17:48.012 --> 00:17:53.765
"I'll live it the way I want."

00:17:57.389 --> 00:17:59.098
You're looking ravishing.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.978
How about a dance with me?

00:18:03.098 --> 00:18:05.264
Excuse me, can't you see
she's not interested in you?

00:18:05.389 --> 00:18:07.269
Please leave.
- It's just one dance.

00:18:07.389 --> 00:18:08.973
But she's not interested.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.098
Come on, it's Valentine's Day.
- Get lost, you sicko!

00:18:12.806 --> 00:18:14.223
Forget it.

00:18:26.098 --> 00:18:28.223
"It's my life."

00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:31.639
"It's my life."

00:18:32.806 --> 00:18:34.056
Hello?

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.536
Yes, dad, I'm heading
to the airport. Right away.

00:18:37.656 --> 00:18:39.436
I'm leaving now.

00:18:39.556 --> 00:18:41.347
Oh no, it's dad again, I've to go.

00:18:41.473 --> 00:18:42.603
But I'll be back.
- Okay, bye.

00:18:42.723 --> 00:18:43.765
Did you get the stuff?
- The best.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.306
Full power. 24 hours.

00:18:48.765 --> 00:18:50.431
Move.
- Take this.

00:18:55.015 --> 00:18:56.182
What's wrong, Bunty?

00:18:58.514 --> 00:19:00.681
Has she come to Valentine's party
or a 'puja' at some temple?

00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:03.015
She's acting so pricey.

00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:08.056
Do you want her?

00:19:10.931 --> 00:19:13.140
Bunty, do you want her?

00:19:13.263 --> 00:19:14.639
What will you do?

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.556
Watch and learn from the best.

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:37.182
Hi.
- Hi.

00:19:37.556 --> 00:19:40.015
Charles Deewan.
- Arya.

00:19:40.738 --> 00:19:41.848
I like what you're wearing.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.473
Thank you.

00:19:44.157 --> 00:19:45.514
Would you like to have
a drink with me?

00:19:47.473 --> 00:19:48.556
No, thanks.

00:19:53.957 --> 00:19:55.473
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:19:56.598 --> 00:19:57.681
None of your business.

00:19:57.806 --> 00:19:59.723
I don't mind.
- Hey, wait...

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:01.765
How much more
are you going to drink?

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.389
I am single.
Sorry, I am Sapna.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.639
Do I look like a waiter to you?

00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:09.514
Jerk.

00:20:21.639 --> 00:20:23.931
'Watch and learn from the best.'

00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:26.473
Shut up!

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:33.223
Try being polite with them, and...

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:47.140
Why don't you tell him?
- What?

00:20:47.264 --> 00:20:50.306
That you like him?
- Are you out of your mind?

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.978
Here. Just go. Go.

00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:57.306
Red rose?
- Go! I am telling you.

00:21:00.306 --> 00:21:06.639
"Hey! Now I am starting
and I know..."

00:21:06.931 --> 00:21:10.556
"I am so done hiding..."

00:21:10.681 --> 00:21:16.263
"And I know it sounds
like I am nowhere."

00:21:16.431 --> 00:21:19.681
"But I don't care..."

00:21:20.056 --> 00:21:23.723
"I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't do this."

00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:26.140
"I don't care, I am free."

00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:40.223
Let's go home.

00:21:41.931 --> 00:21:43.015
Come on.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.347
Forget it.

00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:48.473
What's wrong?

00:21:49.263 --> 00:21:50.598
I feel dizzy.

00:21:52.806 --> 00:21:54.264
Let Rishi come back.

00:21:54.514 --> 00:21:56.431
You stay here, I'll call a cab.

00:22:05.255 --> 00:22:06.801
'Ma'am calling'

00:22:08.556 --> 00:22:09.973
Yes, ma'am?

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.140
One second.

00:22:12.556 --> 00:22:13.890
Yes, tell me.

00:22:14.389 --> 00:22:16.473
I'll be home in 40-45 minutes.

00:22:17.639 --> 00:22:18.665
What?

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:20.140
Yes. Okay.

00:22:23.532 --> 00:22:24.973
Taxi!

00:22:34.556 --> 00:22:35.556
Wait.

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:42.140
She's kicking.

00:22:46.723 --> 00:22:49.431
Hurry up! Hold her legs!

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.098
Who is he?

00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:54.015
He's my friend. You drive.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.936
Hold her legs!
- Tie her hands!

00:22:56.056 --> 00:22:57.556
Now call your mom!

00:22:57.765 --> 00:22:59.514
Call your mom!
- Hold her hands!

00:22:59.765 --> 00:23:00.848
Call her!

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:35.956
Indu, Arya hasn't come home yet.

00:25:42.664 --> 00:25:44.252
Indu.
- Ma'am, did Arya come home?

00:25:44.372 --> 00:25:46.747
Not yet, Indu.
Please, you stay with Piyu.

00:25:46.872 --> 00:25:48.585
I'll go and get her.
- Okay.

00:25:48.705 --> 00:25:50.711
And keep trying Arya's number.

00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:52.081
Okay.
- Keep trying.

00:26:06.914 --> 00:26:10.372
"I scare away one,
two, and many more."

00:26:10.497 --> 00:26:14.081
"My heartbeat increases
when I meet my beloved."

00:26:17.622 --> 00:26:21.122
"I scare away one,
two, and many more."

00:26:21.248 --> 00:26:25.289
"My heartbeat increases
when I meet my beloved."

00:26:26.329 --> 00:26:30.372
"The guard's stick hurts,
it hurts badly."

00:26:31.664 --> 00:26:35.455
"Run for your life. If you get
caught, plead for your life."

00:26:37.497 --> 00:26:39.539
Ritu, where's Arya?

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:42.164
What, ma'am?
- Where is Arya?

00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:43.877
Ma'am, I don't know.
She was here a while ago.

00:26:43.997 --> 00:26:45.330
I can't reach her.

00:26:45.455 --> 00:26:47.293
It's been two hours
since she left for home...

00:26:47.413 --> 00:26:49.209
Wasn't she with Sapna and Rishi?

00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:51.210
Yes, ma'am. - Rishi has no clue.
He doesn't know anything.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.330
Come on, let's dance.

00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:54.455
And Sapna doesn't know anything.

00:26:54.705 --> 00:26:56.169
I am really sorry, ma'am.
We don't know.

00:26:56.289 --> 00:26:58.002
I've to go home. I am really sorry.

00:26:58.122 --> 00:26:59.122
Sorry, ma'am.

00:26:59.248 --> 00:27:01.330
I told Rishi to take care of her.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.747
Sir.

00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:17.289
Sir, I need your help.

00:27:17.497 --> 00:27:18.585
Yes?

00:27:18.705 --> 00:27:20.585
My daughter hasn't
reached home yet.

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.585
Please help me.

00:27:21.705 --> 00:27:24.455
I am quite upset...
- Get a glass of water for her.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.372
My daughter was attending
a party at the farmhouse.

00:27:27.566 --> 00:27:28.711
I'm trying her phone.

00:27:28.831 --> 00:27:31.539
What's your daughter's name?
Which farmhouse did she go to?

00:27:31.914 --> 00:27:33.372
Arya Sabarwal.

00:27:34.956 --> 00:27:37.122
Zodiac Farm.

00:27:37.296 --> 00:27:38.914
Lakhan, what's the matter?

00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:40.747
Sir, her daughter's disappeared.

00:27:41.831 --> 00:27:44.539
She hasn't disappeared.
She just hasn't returned home.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.664
Take a seat, ma'am.
- Sir, I am very worried.

00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:50.293
I've been trying to call her,
but it's unavailable.

00:27:50.413 --> 00:27:52.455
Please.
Sit down and tell us everything.

00:27:53.215 --> 00:27:55.872
How old is your daughter?
- 18 years.

00:27:56.626 --> 00:27:58.081
Give us her phone number.

00:28:00.917 --> 00:28:02.081
Sure?

00:28:02.997 --> 00:28:05.455
Take this and trace
this phone number. - Yes, sir.

00:28:05.705 --> 00:28:07.329
Please, try.

00:28:08.141 --> 00:28:10.831
Why are you so upset?
It's Valentine's Day.

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:12.774
She must be out with her boyfriend.

00:28:12.894 --> 00:28:14.794
There's no way she'll tell you.

00:28:14.914 --> 00:28:16.329
What are you saying?

00:28:16.666 --> 00:28:18.460
Ma'am, kids these days
are just like that.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.209
She must be enjoying somewhere.
Don't worry.

00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:22.289
We deal with such cases every day.
- Sir, please.

00:28:24.232 --> 00:28:27.455
You might have dealt with
similar cases before.

00:28:27.914 --> 00:28:29.956
But my daughter isn't
like any of them.

00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:33.627
She called me at 12:30 and said

00:28:33.747 --> 00:28:35.449
she was coming home in 45 minutes.

00:28:35.569 --> 00:28:37.872
That clearly means
she was coming home!

00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:41.293
Look at the time now.

00:28:41.413 --> 00:28:42.956
It's been three hours.

00:28:43.244 --> 00:28:45.210
She isn't at her friend's place,
nor at the party.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.452
She's not answering her phone.

00:28:46.572 --> 00:28:49.705
No one knows where she is.
Do you get what I am saying?

00:28:51.372 --> 00:28:53.122
I need your help.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.622
Write down your details
in this register.

00:28:55.747 --> 00:28:57.372
And your phone number.

00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:58.914
As well as the description
of your daughter.

00:28:59.034 --> 00:29:01.872
Give me your number,
I'll send you her photograph.

00:29:02.329 --> 00:29:04.914
Okay. We'll inform you as
soon as we get any news.

00:29:05.372 --> 00:29:06.747
You can go home.

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.835
Hello, Indu, just keep trying.

00:29:13.372 --> 00:29:14.539
Hello, ma'am.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.664
I'll call you back, bye.

00:29:17.705 --> 00:29:21.081
My name is Dayashankar Kapoor,
but you can call me DK in short.

00:29:21.548 --> 00:29:23.789
I am a detective. A spy.

00:29:24.997 --> 00:29:26.831
Don't mind the police.

00:29:27.164 --> 00:29:30.081
Dealing with crime every day,
they have become thick-skinned.

00:29:30.675 --> 00:29:32.781
Let me know if I can
be of any use to you.

00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:35.081
No need to hesitate.
- No, thank you.

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:36.669
How sweet of you!

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:38.164
Here's my card.

00:29:42.497 --> 00:29:44.872
Keep this. It's my official card.

00:29:48.081 --> 00:29:50.164
I've quite a reputation
in Daryaganj.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.081
I am a licensed detective, yes.

00:29:52.539 --> 00:29:55.081
By the grace of God,
just from the ashes of a man,

00:29:55.617 --> 00:29:57.329
I can deduce his entire life story.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.122
You're welcome to try.
Best gadget.

00:30:00.336 --> 00:30:02.747
Best surveillance.
Hi-tech equipment.

00:30:03.122 --> 00:30:04.997
I have everything, I guarantee.

00:30:05.117 --> 00:30:06.345
Sir, I need to get home.

00:30:06.465 --> 00:30:08.206
Please, move.
- No, problem, ma'am.

00:30:09.136 --> 00:30:11.122
Have faith in God.
You'll surely find your daughter.

00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:12.497
Everything will be fine.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.956
Your scarf.

00:30:42.872 --> 00:30:44.330
This way, ma'am.

00:30:49.164 --> 00:30:50.831
Excuse me...
- Ma'am.

00:30:50.956 --> 00:30:52.206
Mrs Sabarwal.
- Yes.

00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:53.664
Come with me.

00:30:55.081 --> 00:30:55.956
This way.

00:30:59.655 --> 00:31:01.801
'I.C.U.'

00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:20.705
Oh, God.

00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:30.872
Arya.

00:31:50.413 --> 00:31:52.914
How did it happened?

00:31:54.504 --> 00:31:55.788
Arya.

00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:05.956
'Arya has had severe
internal injuries.'

00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:08.330
'She is still in a state of shock.'

00:32:08.872 --> 00:32:11.997
'It's possible that we might have
to do multiple surgeries.'

00:32:12.248 --> 00:32:15.914
'Because of internal bleeding,
she is unable to eat.'

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.789
'So we will be feeding her
through IV drip.'

00:32:19.497 --> 00:32:24.289
In fact, somebody tried
to strangle her to death.

00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:27.497
They wanted to murder her.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.413
Because of which,
her breathing is inconsistent.

00:32:32.155 --> 00:32:34.997
If she doesn't stabilize soon,
her condition can get critical.

00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:38.831
To be honest with you, ma'am,

00:32:39.872 --> 00:32:43.122
your daughter has
been physically abused.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.539
It's possible that your daughter
has been raped.

00:32:51.872 --> 00:32:53.497
Oh God!

00:33:00.254 --> 00:33:01.622
Ma'am.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.122
She's a strong girl, ma'am.

00:33:19.082 --> 00:33:19.939
'Breaking news'

00:33:20.059 --> 00:33:21.372
'It is the very hospital'

00:33:21.497 --> 00:33:23.580
'where the assault victim
was admitted a while ago.'

00:33:23.747 --> 00:33:26.329
'Sources confirm that
she is in critical condition.'

00:33:26.715 --> 00:33:29.081
'We'll update you as soon as
we've more information.'

00:33:29.206 --> 00:33:32.289
'This is Pankaj Sharma with
cameraman Sahil, Zee News, Delhi.'

00:33:37.872 --> 00:33:40.956
Sir, boss is calling you.

00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:54.539
What's the update on
Sansar Singh's case?

00:33:55.122 --> 00:33:56.705
Charge sheet's been
already filed, sir.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.747
The victim at JP Care Hospital
is no longer an assault case.

00:34:02.523 --> 00:34:03.540
It is rape.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.330
Possibly gang rape.

00:34:05.872 --> 00:34:06.997
Go and take over.

00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:08.622
Yes, sir.

00:34:11.413 --> 00:34:13.248
Mrs Sabarwal.

00:34:19.455 --> 00:34:20.872
Ma'am, please sign here.

00:34:27.955 --> 00:34:29.081
Thank you, ma'am.

00:34:29.372 --> 00:34:30.831
Mrs Sabarwal.

00:34:31.435 --> 00:34:33.539
Matthew Francis, Crime Branch.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.872
I'm extremely sorry about
what has happened.

00:34:38.997 --> 00:34:43.164
I want you to know that
we've started our investigation.

00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:46.622
We're interrogating everyone
present at the party.

00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:50.914
Also, we must record
your daughter's statement

00:34:52.248 --> 00:34:53.956
whenever she regains consciousness.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.413
I'm sure you understand.

00:35:06.197 --> 00:35:07.408
'I.C.U.'

00:35:09.015 --> 00:35:10.664
Anand, please come back.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.705
We really need you.

00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:25.580
Please come back.

00:35:31.747 --> 00:35:33.164
Please.

00:35:44.248 --> 00:35:45.789
Arya.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.789
Dear...

00:36:23.872 --> 00:36:25.081
Dear,

00:36:25.455 --> 00:36:26.872
what do you want?

00:36:27.488 --> 00:36:29.580
Water?

00:36:33.956 --> 00:36:36.580
Bedpan?

00:36:36.705 --> 00:36:38.128
Hold on.

00:36:38.248 --> 00:36:39.664
Hold on, I'll get it.

00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:46.330
Bedpan.

00:37:27.413 --> 00:37:29.914
Please, dear. A little.

00:37:43.455 --> 00:37:45.622
I am sorry.

00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:47.497
I am sorry.

00:38:20.497 --> 00:38:22.122
Did she say anything?

00:38:34.473 --> 00:38:36.206
Tell us something, dear.

00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:39.664
Who were they?

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:45.206
We know

00:38:47.164 --> 00:38:48.580
how hard...

00:38:49.789 --> 00:38:51.413
this is...

00:38:51.956 --> 00:38:54.330
For you.

00:38:55.289 --> 00:39:00.329
But only you can get them punished.

00:39:02.749 --> 00:39:05.330
If you know...
- Do you know...

00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:16.580
Do you know what he was screaming?

00:39:30.539 --> 00:39:32.747
'Call your mom.'

00:39:40.606 --> 00:39:43.622
I don't remember
anything after that.

00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:51.122
Sir, the girl has given
her statement.

00:40:05.664 --> 00:40:07.039
Get up!

00:40:07.289 --> 00:40:08.872
Come on!

00:40:09.164 --> 00:40:10.669
Leave my collar!
- Come on!

00:40:10.789 --> 00:40:12.460
What have I done?
- Let go.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.580
Brother!
- Where are you taking me?

00:40:15.039 --> 00:40:17.210
Come on, you...
- Let go.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.460
What have I done?

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.747
Where are you taking me?

00:40:20.206 --> 00:40:21.289
Leave my collar.

00:40:21.497 --> 00:40:22.789
Leave my collar!

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:25.085
You will pay for this, inspector.

00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:30.039
Sir, let me go.
- Sir, where you are taking him?

00:40:31.622 --> 00:40:33.789
I haven't done anything.
- Where are you taking him?

00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:35.413
Sir...

00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:38.248
Sir.
- Sir, don't hit him.

00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:44.789
Come on!

00:40:45.413 --> 00:40:47.081
What has he done?

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:49.831
Sir, let him go.

00:40:49.956 --> 00:40:51.473
We know he's your friend.

00:40:51.593 --> 00:40:55.289
Say it clearly.
- His name is Jagan Singh.

00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:10.002
Don't die before I return.

00:41:10.122 --> 00:41:11.664
Where are you taking him?
- I'll be back soon.

00:41:12.956 --> 00:41:14.128
Get up!

00:41:14.248 --> 00:41:15.956
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

00:41:16.122 --> 00:41:17.335
Come on!

00:41:17.455 --> 00:41:19.044
Open the door!

00:41:19.164 --> 00:41:20.747
Come on!
- Uncle, I'll be back soon.

00:41:21.122 --> 00:41:22.329
Get in!

00:41:22.789 --> 00:41:24.330
Get in!

00:41:27.248 --> 00:41:29.521
I could've done that myself, Tara.

00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:32.580
Then you should've done it by now.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:37.497
Can I get a cup of tea?
The weather's playing tricks again.

00:41:38.972 --> 00:41:40.329
No tea for you!

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.122
I'll get it.

00:41:44.149 --> 00:41:46.081
What is the English for 'Tara'?

00:41:46.831 --> 00:41:48.081
Star.

00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:50.039
She's got tantrums of a star.

00:41:50.206 --> 00:41:52.580
'The Valentine's Day rape case...'
- Go back.

00:41:53.182 --> 00:41:55.872
'The victim gave her statement.
This is a case of a gang...'

00:41:55.997 --> 00:41:58.585
'The victim was kidnapped
from Zodiac Farm.'

00:41:58.705 --> 00:41:59.877
No one's safe
in this country anymore.

00:41:59.997 --> 00:42:02.122
'She was found next morning
in critical condition in a drain.'

00:42:02.248 --> 00:42:03.580
'The victim has identified
four people'

00:42:03.705 --> 00:42:04.919
'through video conferencing.'
- Tea.

00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:06.711
'The Crime Branch has
taken over the case.'

00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:09.081
'Officer Matthew Francis
is the lead investigator.'

00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:12.707
Nothing's ever going
to change in this country.

00:42:12.956 --> 00:42:14.411
Why not, mom?

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:16.877
The government will have
to do something for this.

00:42:16.997 --> 00:42:19.497
The people need to wake up.

00:42:19.622 --> 00:42:21.585
You must come home
early from your tuitions.

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:24.236
Mom?
- Don't you see what's happening?

00:42:24.356 --> 00:42:25.210
What are you saying?

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.122
What am I saying?
Why don't you say something?

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:30.081
It always has to be me.

00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:32.212
'It has gone
to the fast track court.'

00:42:32.332 --> 00:42:36.375
'Victim has asked for permission to
depose through video conference.'

00:42:36.495 --> 00:42:39.148
'Fast track court. Court 304
Spl. District Judge Hari Sharma'

00:42:39.268 --> 00:42:42.657
'When they thought I was dead,'

00:42:45.257 --> 00:42:47.282
'they threw me'

00:42:47.616 --> 00:42:49.699
'out of their car.'

00:42:54.516 --> 00:42:56.991
'They wanted to kill me.'

00:43:03.919 --> 00:43:07.127
Sir, we seek permission
for their forensic tests.

00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:09.586
Granted.
- Thank you, sir.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.544
Arya's injuries are
consistent with her story.

00:43:16.711 --> 00:43:19.086
I am completely sure
she's telling the truth.

00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:23.336
And the rest can be proved after
we receive the forensic report.

00:43:23.461 --> 00:43:25.127
Everyone says that
we'll lose this case

00:43:25.294 --> 00:43:27.211
as soon as the
forensic reports arrive.

00:43:28.045 --> 00:43:29.211
Please do something.

00:43:29.784 --> 00:43:32.670
This is Arya Sabarwal's blood
report on the 14th of February.

00:43:33.086 --> 00:43:36.044
Blood alcohol content is 0.08.

00:43:37.294 --> 00:43:39.586
Her statement is not reliable.

00:43:39.961 --> 00:43:41.751
'I am at the court.
I'll call you back.'

00:43:45.461 --> 00:43:47.127
Sir, this is the victim's phone.

00:43:47.253 --> 00:43:49.294
The police recovered it
from the exact same location

00:43:49.414 --> 00:43:51.628
where she claimed
she was kidnapped.

00:43:51.877 --> 00:43:53.632
'Sit here, I'll call a cab.'

00:43:53.752 --> 00:43:56.670
'Sir, I was at that party
from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am.'

00:43:57.002 --> 00:43:59.752
Charles and Mohit were with me.
They never left.

00:44:00.009 --> 00:44:02.586
In fact, she left the party.

00:44:03.627 --> 00:44:05.253
These are their phone records.

00:44:05.378 --> 00:44:07.715
The triangulated positions show
that Charles was at the party.

00:44:07.835 --> 00:44:10.253
And Baburam never left his post.

00:44:10.758 --> 00:44:13.919
And Mohit's teacher
broke his phone. So...

00:44:15.294 --> 00:44:17.882
The traffic signal cameras..
- Sir, verification.

00:44:18.002 --> 00:44:19.586
It's verified.
- Thank you, sir.

00:44:19.805 --> 00:44:21.752
Sir, we've got footage of the car

00:44:21.877 --> 00:44:24.127
between the farmhouse
and the drain.

00:44:24.378 --> 00:44:26.211
It's Charles Deewan's car

00:44:26.336 --> 00:44:27.961
which the victim mentioned
in her statement.

00:44:28.086 --> 00:44:30.919
Sir, the car was
completely washed.

00:44:31.263 --> 00:44:32.835
No prints, no fluids.

00:44:40.294 --> 00:44:41.550
You two go back to the party.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.216
And you, back to your post.
I'll go and wash the car. Okay?

00:44:44.336 --> 00:44:45.715
I was driving the car.

00:44:45.835 --> 00:44:48.378
I borrowed the car from the boss...

00:44:49.002 --> 00:44:51.877
I mean, from my friend Charles...

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:55.503
Since it was the Valentine's Day,

00:44:55.628 --> 00:44:57.961
and I wanted to take my girlfriend

00:44:59.002 --> 00:45:00.002
for a drive.

00:45:00.127 --> 00:45:04.378
Sir, his phone's location proves
that he was in the car.

00:45:04.628 --> 00:45:06.378
With his girlfriend, of course.

00:45:11.922 --> 00:45:13.961
I called the police immediately
after I found her.

00:45:14.713 --> 00:45:16.340
But I thought it was better to
take her to the nearest hospital

00:45:16.705 --> 00:45:19.211
instead of waiting for the police.

00:45:19.336 --> 00:45:22.877
Note down. The victim was found
where she claims she was thrown.

00:45:23.002 --> 00:45:26.253
Before I left, Mohit was
misbehaving with Arya.

00:45:26.455 --> 00:45:29.631
By the time I got back,
Sapna was quite dizzy

00:45:29.751 --> 00:45:31.919
and Arya's phone was unreachable.

00:45:32.044 --> 00:45:34.336
After that, I dropped Sapna home.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:39.174
And finally, Baburam has confessed
to the police...

00:45:39.294 --> 00:45:41.127
Objection! Inadmissible.

00:45:41.253 --> 00:45:43.586
Sustained. Don't waste my time.

00:45:46.654 --> 00:45:49.632
Don't you think your friend
left with her boyfriend?

00:45:49.752 --> 00:45:51.169
They would've had an argument...

00:45:51.294 --> 00:45:52.586
Objection! Character assassination!

00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:54.508
But unfortunately in our society.
- Sustained!

00:45:54.628 --> 00:45:56.461
We cannot openly admit to affairs.

00:45:56.581 --> 00:45:58.086
Objection, sir.
- She blamed it on someone else.

00:45:58.211 --> 00:45:59.670
Sustained! Stop this rubbish!

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.711
Show some sensitivity.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:04.877
Sorry, sir.

00:46:10.611 --> 00:46:14.378
Did you see Mohit when you
arrived at the party?

00:46:14.498 --> 00:46:16.244
'Day 32'

00:46:23.441 --> 00:46:24.378
Yes.

00:46:24.498 --> 00:46:26.378
And Baburam even opened
the gate for you.

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:31.752
'I'm here to pick up my daughter.'

00:46:33.284 --> 00:46:34.619
'Day 32'

00:46:34.794 --> 00:46:36.253
Say it louder.

00:46:36.373 --> 00:46:38.336
Yes, but...

00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:41.835
I got there at around 2:00 am.

00:46:42.058 --> 00:46:45.752
But my daughter Arya was
missing since 12:30 am.

00:46:46.347 --> 00:46:49.711
So you admit that they were
at the party, but Arya wasn't.

00:46:50.711 --> 00:46:52.461
Objection!
Leading the witness, sir.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:54.044
Denied.

00:46:58.877 --> 00:47:01.086
What's all this nonsense
in the court?

00:47:01.503 --> 00:47:03.049
According to
the Supreme Court's maxim,

00:47:03.169 --> 00:47:06.674
the victim's statement is enough
for a conviction. Even I know that.

00:47:06.794 --> 00:47:10.114
But this maxim is based on
the fact that people can lie,

00:47:10.234 --> 00:47:11.794
circumstances cannot.

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.628
Shall we go home, dear?

00:47:23.419 --> 00:47:25.044
You've been discharged.

00:47:25.794 --> 00:47:27.086
Shall we go home?

00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:33.751
Arya and Devki always
had a problem with me.

00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:35.586
So it's quite obvious
they took my name.

00:47:36.144 --> 00:47:38.544
And why will I do it, sir?
I am in love with Arya.

00:47:39.044 --> 00:47:41.544
I'm sorry to say this,
but if I had been there that day,

00:47:42.253 --> 00:47:43.711
I would've never spared those guys.

00:47:43.831 --> 00:47:45.007
'Day 33'

00:47:45.127 --> 00:47:46.550
Will you please introduce yourself?

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.086
I am Dr Mohit Bhatt.

00:47:48.206 --> 00:47:50.216
I'm a Grade 1 Senior
Scientific Officer

00:47:50.336 --> 00:47:52.383
at the Central Forensic Laboratory.

00:47:52.503 --> 00:47:55.383
Did you prepare this report?
- I did.

00:47:55.503 --> 00:47:56.670
What's written in it?

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.953
'Day 35'

00:47:59.169 --> 00:48:00.835
The report is negative.

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:03.011
The accused's forensic samples

00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:07.086
and the samples collected
from Arya's body do not match.

00:48:07.253 --> 00:48:08.586
How is this possible?

00:48:09.002 --> 00:48:11.086
Arya gave her statement
three days later.

00:48:11.626 --> 00:48:14.086
The swabs were collected
after 72 hours.

00:48:14.547 --> 00:48:16.294
It was destroyed by then.

00:48:16.469 --> 00:48:18.424
But don't worry. We'll apply again.

00:48:18.544 --> 00:48:20.253
This time it will be positive.

00:49:25.752 --> 00:49:28.919
It's really unfortunate that
the prosecutrix was raped.

00:49:29.039 --> 00:49:30.216
'Day 37'

00:49:30.336 --> 00:49:32.461
She has sustained severe
wounds on her body.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.586
And there was an attempt
to kill her as well.

00:49:36.197 --> 00:49:39.378
Since she was under
the influence of alcohol

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.835
on the night of 14th February,
her statement cannot be relied on.

00:49:43.971 --> 00:49:48.211
Even the prosecution has failed
to corroborate her statement.

00:49:48.649 --> 00:49:52.544
The court believes that even
if thousands of guilty go free,

00:49:52.901 --> 00:49:55.794
not a single innocent soul
should be punished.

00:49:56.044 --> 00:50:00.335
It cannot be proven
beyond reasonable doubt

00:50:01.205 --> 00:50:05.711
that Charles Deewan,
Mohit Chadha, Baburam Pande

00:50:06.144 --> 00:50:08.419
and Joginder Singh
committed the crime.

00:50:08.823 --> 00:50:11.628
And so the court acquits them.

00:50:11.748 --> 00:50:14.049
Huh.

00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:16.544
Jagan...
- Wonderful.

00:50:18.196 --> 00:50:19.919
What an amazing lawyer!

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.044
I won't spare you!

00:50:23.294 --> 00:50:25.336
Let go of me...
- Stop them!

00:50:25.503 --> 00:50:27.211
Take him out of the court.
- Arrest him!

00:50:27.336 --> 00:50:29.711
This is contempt of court.
- Shut up!

00:50:34.419 --> 00:50:35.503
Come on.

00:50:35.623 --> 00:50:37.111
Anand, what happened?

00:50:37.231 --> 00:50:39.835
Devki, this is really unfair.
- Where are you taking him?

00:50:39.961 --> 00:50:41.503
Hold on...
- This is not justice.

00:50:41.628 --> 00:50:43.091
Where are you taking him?

00:50:43.211 --> 00:50:45.544
Anand!
- Ma'am, please...

00:50:46.253 --> 00:50:47.258
Anand!
- Devki.

00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:48.628
Ma'am, please.
- Stop!

00:50:50.044 --> 00:50:51.419
Anand!

00:50:57.752 --> 00:51:00.461
The court acquitted everyone.
- I can't believe it.

00:51:00.877 --> 00:51:03.049
Mr Sabarwal punched
Jagan in a fit of rage,

00:51:03.169 --> 00:51:05.419
and he was arrested
for contempt of court.

00:51:06.752 --> 00:51:08.961
But don't worry, ma'am.
We'll get him out.

00:51:21.002 --> 00:51:22.336
He's here.

00:51:23.919 --> 00:51:25.461
Sir, sign here.

00:51:40.169 --> 00:51:42.002
I am so sorry about
what has happened.

00:51:42.752 --> 00:51:44.503
I can understand
what you are going through.

00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:46.211
You won't understand.

00:51:49.034 --> 00:51:51.127
You can get away with rape
in this country,

00:51:51.925 --> 00:51:54.169
but you can't even slap a rapist.

00:51:55.283 --> 00:51:58.211
Ma'am, the police
never discriminate.

00:51:59.023 --> 00:52:01.628
Anyone who breaks the law
is our enemy. - Please.

00:52:03.012 --> 00:52:05.294
I've no more expectations.

00:52:06.533 --> 00:52:10.294
Not from the police, nor the law.

00:52:27.044 --> 00:52:28.378
Yes, Indu?

00:52:29.961 --> 00:52:31.794
Please open the door.
- What happened?

00:52:32.138 --> 00:52:35.503
Arya saw the verdict on
the television

00:52:35.855 --> 00:52:37.294
and locked herself inside.

00:52:37.414 --> 00:52:39.044
What was everyone doing?

00:52:39.164 --> 00:52:40.461
Why did you leave her alone?

00:52:40.586 --> 00:52:42.294
Open the door.
- I couldn't do anything.

00:52:42.544 --> 00:52:44.253
Arya!
- Arya, please.

00:52:45.336 --> 00:52:46.631
Arya!
- Arya!

00:52:46.751 --> 00:52:48.461
Dear, please.
- Arya...

00:52:48.835 --> 00:52:51.294
Arya!
- Oh, God!

00:53:07.308 --> 00:53:08.628
Arya!

00:53:16.711 --> 00:53:17.752
Calm down, Arya.

00:53:18.961 --> 00:53:20.044
Arya!

00:53:20.877 --> 00:53:22.544
Indu, take her away
- Mom!

00:53:23.752 --> 00:53:25.086
Arya!

00:53:26.294 --> 00:53:27.670
Arya, calm down.

00:53:28.169 --> 00:53:30.628
Arya, calm down.

00:53:30.748 --> 00:53:32.378
No, Arya!

00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:35.503
Calm down.

00:53:37.044 --> 00:53:39.294
Arya, calm down.

00:53:39.797 --> 00:53:41.002
Arya...

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:44.336
Calm down.

00:53:46.294 --> 00:53:47.751
Calm down, Arya.

00:53:47.877 --> 00:53:49.419
Calm down.

00:53:49.539 --> 00:53:50.670
Calm down.

00:53:52.794 --> 00:53:55.294
Calm down.

00:55:15.461 --> 00:55:16.670
She's asleep.

00:55:19.978 --> 00:55:22.002
We can't give up, Devki.

00:55:25.127 --> 00:55:26.544
We must fight.

00:55:27.718 --> 00:55:29.503
We'll appeal to the High Court.

00:55:31.468 --> 00:55:32.961
They will be hanged to death.

00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:35.253
They'll be punished.

00:55:36.784 --> 00:55:38.336
Arya is the one

00:55:39.437 --> 00:55:41.336
who's being punished.

00:55:43.133 --> 00:55:45.002
Trying to live our lives

00:55:45.919 --> 00:55:47.670
with this incident haunting us,

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:53.044
nothing can be worse than that.

00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:58.711
I always thought

00:55:59.872 --> 00:56:04.127
everything will be eventually fine
between Arya and me.

00:56:06.773 --> 00:56:08.752
But now it's all over.

00:56:11.127 --> 00:56:12.919
My daughter

00:56:14.461 --> 00:56:16.503
has gone so far from me

00:56:17.588 --> 00:56:19.711
that coming back from there...

00:56:22.336 --> 00:56:24.127
I lost her.

00:56:28.056 --> 00:56:30.044
I've lost her, Anand.

00:56:34.186 --> 00:56:35.794
I've lost her.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.628
You are awake, dear.

00:57:09.537 --> 00:57:11.253
I've decided that

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:14.752
we should go out somewhere.

00:57:20.134 --> 00:57:23.670
How about that place you suggested?

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:31.544
It's alright. But do let me know

00:57:32.567 --> 00:57:34.294
once you change your mind.

00:57:43.544 --> 00:57:46.711
Mom, when will sister
come back to school?

00:57:47.123 --> 00:57:48.670
Very soon.

00:57:52.086 --> 00:57:54.211
I'm not talking to you.
- Okay.

00:57:55.586 --> 00:57:57.378
Stop bothering me, Mohit.

00:57:57.503 --> 00:57:59.632
Your brother just got back.
- Bye, mom.

00:57:59.752 --> 00:58:02.336
How many months into pregnancy
have you been?

00:58:03.734 --> 00:58:05.086
How many months?

00:58:08.752 --> 00:58:10.438
How can you allow him
back in school?

00:58:10.558 --> 00:58:12.002
The court's acquitted him.

00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:14.294
He's innocent by law.

00:58:15.752 --> 00:58:17.378
So you're saying that

00:58:17.975 --> 00:58:19.670
my daughter's lying?

00:58:20.128 --> 00:58:21.670
I didn't say that.

00:58:22.226 --> 00:58:24.127
But I can't take any action
against him.

00:58:25.953 --> 00:58:28.002
What excuse can
I give for expelling him?

00:58:29.497 --> 00:58:31.794
That the court didn't believe Arya,

00:58:32.367 --> 00:58:34.961
but we do!

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:40.127
So you won't do anything.

00:58:41.433 --> 00:58:43.586
His parents will sue the school.

00:59:00.844 --> 00:59:02.419
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning...

00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:22.911
Stop calling me constantly.
Tell Charles I am coming.

00:59:23.031 --> 00:59:24.503
Coming to meet him.

00:59:25.216 --> 00:59:26.966
I'd to skip lectures
because of you.

00:59:27.086 --> 00:59:29.002
Now hang up and stop bothering me.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.461
A lawyer like Bansal
will definitely help our case.

01:01:06.828 --> 01:01:07.711
Go for it.

01:01:16.818 --> 01:01:18.169
I'll call you later.

01:01:26.877 --> 01:01:28.299
Devki, what happened to the car?
- It's nothing.

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:30.253
Just a small accident.
- Accident?

01:01:30.373 --> 01:01:32.513
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am fine.

01:01:32.633 --> 01:01:34.127
No wonder you're so late.

01:01:34.973 --> 01:01:37.503
Indu also had to leave...
- Anand.

01:01:38.677 --> 01:01:40.586
I cannot teach at that
school any longer.

01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:44.042
And we'll shift Priya
to another school.

01:01:45.586 --> 01:01:46.751
What happened?

01:01:47.554 --> 01:01:48.919
He's back in school.

01:01:50.181 --> 01:01:51.419
Who?

01:01:57.503 --> 01:01:58.711
Mohit?

01:03:02.384 --> 01:03:05.916
'DK'

01:03:07.628 --> 01:03:11.378
I suggest you find someone else.
He's not a nice guy.

01:03:12.181 --> 01:03:14.378
What are you saying, DK?
- Exactly.

01:03:14.628 --> 01:03:17.503
I wonder if my daughter
will ever get married.

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.586
I know a guy.

01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:21.711
Fresh in the market.

01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:25.211
He'll be absolutely right
for your daughter.

01:03:25.894 --> 01:03:27.044
Look here.

01:03:28.586 --> 01:03:30.211
Tell me something, Mr DK.

01:03:30.961 --> 01:03:33.378
Are you a detective
or a matchmaker?

01:03:33.628 --> 01:03:35.711
Just your well-wisher, Mr Bagga.

01:03:41.253 --> 01:03:42.628
Just a moment.

01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:45.044
Where are you going?
- Just check his profile.

01:03:45.546 --> 01:03:48.127
Ma'am, where are you going?

01:03:49.638 --> 01:03:50.835
Please, come in.

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:53.211
I came here by mistake.

01:03:53.461 --> 01:03:55.133
You're holding my visiting card,

01:03:55.253 --> 01:03:57.294
and you claim to have
come by mistake.

01:03:58.982 --> 01:04:00.961
How can I be of service?

01:04:03.087 --> 01:04:05.336
I know everything about your case.

01:04:06.127 --> 01:04:08.628
The court didn't just make
a mistake, they have sinned.

01:04:10.336 --> 01:04:12.804
I can feel what you're feeling.

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:19.092
No one knows what I am feeling.

01:04:22.636 --> 01:04:27.127
I may not be a good enough
detective to deduce feelings,

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:29.253
but I am a father nevertheless.

01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:32.294
I have a daughter.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.378
She's the same age
as your daughter.

01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:36.455
Look at this, she's very beautiful.

01:04:36.575 --> 01:04:38.919
Thankfully she's taken
after her mother.

01:04:43.048 --> 01:04:45.378
I can understand
what you're feeling.

01:04:46.456 --> 01:04:49.751
But don't worry.
I am a professional.

01:04:50.835 --> 01:04:53.961
Client secrecy is my top priority.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.127
I swear to God.

01:04:59.878 --> 01:05:01.336
I...

01:05:03.008 --> 01:05:04.586
I want information.

01:05:09.002 --> 01:05:10.253
You'll get it.

01:05:10.793 --> 01:05:13.127
You'll get the information. But...

01:05:13.336 --> 01:05:15.711
From this moment onwards,
I don't know you,

01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:18.253
and you don't know me.

01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:43.226
'Welcome to Rajiv Chowk
Metro Station.'

01:05:43.768 --> 01:05:47.184
'Please stand clear of the door.
Thank you.'

01:06:02.017 --> 01:06:05.017
On Mondays, Baburam gets off
early from work.

01:06:06.979 --> 01:06:09.184
Every Monday night,

01:06:09.434 --> 01:06:13.434
he sits at the same bar and
drinks till it shuts down.

01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:18.684
I don't know whether
what I am doing is right or wrong.

01:06:19.016 --> 01:06:20.434
It's wrong.

01:06:21.005 --> 01:06:22.684
But doing nothing

01:06:23.976 --> 01:06:25.434
is worse than that.

01:06:28.126 --> 01:06:31.559
If you have to choose between
wrong and very wrong,

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:34.601
then what will you choose?

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.017
The address of the bar.

01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:51.434
Is the information
absolutely correct?

01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:55.851
Have faith in God.
He'll fix everything.

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:03.434
God can't be everywhere, Mr DK.

01:07:05.892 --> 01:07:07.518
I know.

01:07:07.851 --> 01:07:09.934
That's why He created mothers.

01:09:26.805 --> 01:09:29.771
It takes only one lifetime
to be born as a woman.

01:09:30.101 --> 01:09:33.305
But only after one thousand
and eighteen rebirths,

01:09:33.425 --> 01:09:37.014
does one get the privilege
of being born as a man.

01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:38.757
Drunkard!

01:09:39.465 --> 01:09:41.632
Rubbish!
- What?

01:09:42.174 --> 01:09:44.966
You're talking rubbish.
- You've lost your mind.

01:09:45.258 --> 01:09:47.382
Get lost.
- "Lipstick..."

01:10:10.863 --> 01:10:15.799
"Your waist looks voluptuous."

01:10:16.507 --> 01:10:20.511
"Your waist looks voluptuous."

01:10:30.174 --> 01:10:33.716
"Your waist looks voluptuous."

01:10:34.004 --> 01:10:35.716
"Your waist..."

01:10:37.813 --> 01:10:39.382
Why are you shying away from me?

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.216
Show me your face.

01:11:17.757 --> 01:11:20.507
Why are you screaming?
Where were you the last three days?

01:11:20.757 --> 01:11:23.341
Why didn't you come home?
I am asking you something.

01:11:23.465 --> 01:11:24.716
Who were you sleeping with?

01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:27.174
Are you going to answer me?
Where were you?

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.924
I am asking you!
- Shut up!

01:11:32.507 --> 01:11:34.966
Why did you come back?
I even called at your office.

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:37.174
Where were you for
the last four days?

01:11:37.883 --> 01:11:40.381
I had made up my mind
to go to the police.

01:11:41.049 --> 01:11:44.049
Why marry me if this is
what you wanted to do?

01:11:58.216 --> 01:12:01.757
Why are you screaming?
I can scream too, you know.

01:12:06.924 --> 01:12:08.465
What are you breaking in there?

01:12:08.674 --> 01:12:10.757
Will you show your
manliness in there?

01:12:12.008 --> 01:12:13.632
It's my bad luck.

01:12:21.049 --> 01:12:22.465
'What's the matter with you'

01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:25.591
'She called you four times,
but you didn't reply.'

01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:27.174
'And also...'

01:12:28.091 --> 01:12:29.465
Piyu!

01:12:30.071 --> 01:12:31.262
'He was the same security guard'

01:12:31.382 --> 01:12:34.381
'who was recently arrested
in connection to a gang rape case.'

01:12:37.757 --> 01:12:40.381
Piyu!
- Coming, mom.

01:12:45.341 --> 01:12:48.674
'A perfect blend
of handpicked spices.'

01:12:49.216 --> 01:12:51.381
'It is made with
the latest method.'

01:12:51.757 --> 01:12:53.008
'Catch spices.'

01:12:53.381 --> 01:12:56.304
'Every morsel of the food
will be aromatic.'

01:12:56.424 --> 01:12:58.429
'The security guard
Baburam was acquitted'

01:12:58.549 --> 01:13:00.387
'in the Valentine's Day rape case.'

01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:03.300
'He was found dead in his house,
in castrated condition.'

01:13:04.632 --> 01:13:07.174
'According to sources,
he was missing for four days'

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:12.884
'and he was last seen on Monday
night at Vishwakarma bar.'

01:13:15.799 --> 01:13:21.799
"The morning is young."

01:13:25.382 --> 01:13:29.424
"If you are upset"

01:13:30.632 --> 01:13:34.716
"with the morning,"

01:13:44.757 --> 01:13:49.841
"you'll be broken."

01:13:51.073 --> 01:13:56.507
"It will be difficult
to be forgiven."

01:14:02.147 --> 01:14:07.381
"It will be difficult
to be forgiven."

01:14:11.004 --> 01:14:12.549
This is definitely revenge.

01:14:15.799 --> 01:14:18.424
No, sir. They are decent people.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.549
Really?
- Yes, sir.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.757
How can I help you?

01:14:33.799 --> 01:14:36.174
You must have heard
what happened with Baburam.

01:14:36.368 --> 01:14:38.424
He deserved
whatever happened to him.

01:14:42.091 --> 01:14:44.133
The problem is, Mr Anand,
that this is no coincidence.

01:14:44.767 --> 01:14:45.924
It was deliberate.

01:14:46.341 --> 01:14:49.465
The question is who...
- I wish it was me.

01:14:51.325 --> 01:14:53.465
My deputy Rashid...

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.799
Even he believes this is revenge.

01:14:57.548 --> 01:14:59.300
But I said...

01:14:59.883 --> 01:15:02.154
It can't be you.
You're decent people.

01:15:02.274 --> 01:15:05.424
Decent but not stupid!

01:15:09.424 --> 01:15:11.674
You're suspecting me!

01:15:13.465 --> 01:15:15.382
You think I did it!

01:15:16.757 --> 01:15:19.341
I think a man's capable of doing
anything when he's angry.

01:15:20.542 --> 01:15:22.507
Yes, I am angry.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.465
But I still have faith.

01:15:25.186 --> 01:15:27.133
That we will get justice.

01:15:28.465 --> 01:15:30.133
Nice to hear that.

01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:33.757
I shall leave.

01:15:34.055 --> 01:15:35.841
Sorry for bothering you.

01:15:40.133 --> 01:15:42.424
Keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:50.674 --> 01:15:52.258
This is his new series.

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:54.133
It's an interesting take.

01:15:55.192 --> 01:15:57.757
We're in a gallery.
Take off your sunglasses.

01:15:58.382 --> 01:16:00.300
People will laugh at you.

01:16:01.113 --> 01:16:04.262
I never leave home without
my mother's blessings

01:16:04.382 --> 01:16:06.382
and my sunglasses.

01:16:13.965 --> 01:16:19.341
Did you get the information
I asked for?

01:16:20.883 --> 01:16:26.424
"Tormenting images."

01:16:26.703 --> 01:16:28.258
Yes.

01:16:29.258 --> 01:16:31.091
I think it belongs to an elephant.

01:16:31.929 --> 01:16:33.549
It's a pen drive.

01:17:00.465 --> 01:17:02.258
I've already sent you a message

01:17:02.381 --> 01:17:04.376
with the procedure
for disabling CCTV.

01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:06.341
You can see it later.

01:17:09.507 --> 01:17:14.008
Leave five minutes after I do.

01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:18.674
Stay here for a while
and appreciate this painting.

01:17:22.133 --> 01:17:24.258
What is this painting about?

01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:30.596
It's when Draupadi
washed her tresses

01:17:30.716 --> 01:17:32.341
with Dushashan's blood.

01:17:34.638 --> 01:17:36.674
Look around you.

01:17:37.561 --> 01:17:41.341
This artist's theme is
'Mahabharata'.

01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:45.591
The oldest revenge story.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.382
Where is Draupadi?

01:18:01.174 --> 01:18:03.591
It's modern art.

01:18:08.799 --> 01:18:13.507
"Come out of this painting."

01:18:13.841 --> 01:18:16.549
I could've made this painting
by spitting after having a 'paan'.

01:18:16.924 --> 01:18:18.846
Unbelievable!
If you get it, it's art.

01:18:18.966 --> 01:18:20.207
If you don't, it's modern art.

01:18:20.327 --> 01:18:21.971
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir. How can I help you?

01:18:22.091 --> 01:18:24.095
How much for this red canvas?

01:18:24.215 --> 01:18:27.049
5 million.
- 5 million?

01:18:27.174 --> 01:18:28.841
Yes, sir. It's already sold out.

01:18:29.695 --> 01:18:31.591
Did you receive payment?
- Yes.

01:18:34.424 --> 01:18:35.716
Draupadi.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.591
'Charles Deewan.'

01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:45.381
'The only son of an Indian father
and a British mother.'

01:18:45.674 --> 01:18:49.757
'His parents are no more,
but they left everything for him.'

01:18:50.049 --> 01:18:52.174
'He lives all alone in
Bungalow 11,'

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.883
'Green Field society,
Greater Noida.'

01:18:55.008 --> 01:18:57.216
'He's a partner in a nightclub.'

01:18:57.591 --> 01:19:01.716
'And every Saturday night,
he parties at that club.'

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:05.966
'His servant also takes an off
on Saturday night.'

01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:08.465
'He returns on Sunday morning.'

01:19:11.632 --> 01:19:15.387
'And his cousin, Mohit Chadha,
also known as Bunty.'

01:19:15.507 --> 01:19:17.632
'Both his parents are pilots'

01:19:17.757 --> 01:19:19.387
'and they often travel.'

01:19:19.507 --> 01:19:23.216
'So he spends most of his time
with his cousin Charles.'

01:19:23.757 --> 01:19:26.674
'Both of them frequently visit
each other's home.'

01:19:26.799 --> 01:19:30.373
'Charles always has a spare key
to Mohit's house at his home.'

01:19:30.493 --> 01:19:33.465
'Charles Deewan is
a fitness freak.'

01:19:33.658 --> 01:19:37.716
'From whey protein to carotene,
he takes every supplement.'

01:19:37.841 --> 01:19:41.465
'Let me know if there's
any other information you want.'

01:19:42.219 --> 01:19:45.674
'Well then... Okay.'

01:20:14.757 --> 01:20:16.381
So what's the problem?

01:20:17.008 --> 01:20:19.216
Can't you get a single date
for an appeal?

01:20:21.091 --> 01:20:23.465
I don't think you're interested
in this case any longer.

01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:25.507
Hold on.

01:20:26.369 --> 01:20:28.465
Where are you going?
- We're out of groceries.

01:20:28.799 --> 01:20:30.381
I'll be late.

01:20:30.757 --> 01:20:32.424
Yes, sir...
- Also, need to see the tailor.

01:20:33.438 --> 01:20:35.341
I don't care if there are
other cases pending.

01:20:35.538 --> 01:20:37.465
Now don't give me excuses, please.

01:20:37.716 --> 01:20:39.091
'Sir, he's still at home.'

01:20:39.883 --> 01:20:41.632
Do not lose sight of him, Rashid.

01:20:42.024 --> 01:20:43.174
No chance, sir.

01:20:43.519 --> 01:20:45.382
I haven't gone home for
three days myself.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.133
I think he's very decent.

01:20:47.549 --> 01:20:48.799
It's been six days.

01:20:48.924 --> 01:20:51.700
Home to his office, to and fro,
that's all he does.

01:20:51.966 --> 01:20:53.929
He never even jumps a signal,
even at night.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.341
He's a law-abiding citizen.
- I asked you to keep an eye.

01:20:56.841 --> 01:20:58.632
I didn't ask for your opinion.

01:20:59.091 --> 01:21:00.465
Sorry, sir.

01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:31.091
Can you open it?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:21:40.674 --> 01:21:42.049
The gardener...

01:21:42.858 --> 01:21:45.465
I've told him a thousand times

01:21:47.133 --> 01:21:48.632
not to leave it here.

01:21:49.841 --> 01:21:52.382
The children can trip over.

01:22:00.799 --> 01:22:01.757
It's open.

01:22:02.174 --> 01:22:03.382
Come on.
- Here you go.

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:05.591
The children will be home soon.

01:22:08.279 --> 01:22:10.674
Keep this money. Let's go.

01:22:11.465 --> 01:22:13.674
It's okay, ma'am.
- Here you go, mister.

01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:15.465
Thank you.

01:24:12.632 --> 01:24:15.721
"This is a spark."

01:24:15.841 --> 01:24:18.381
"Who will it burn?"

01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:27.133
"The scream hidden in your heart,
who does it call out to?"

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:36.008
"You've torched my life."

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:41.554
"You die daily..."
- Yes, come on!

01:24:41.674 --> 01:24:43.966
"Who do you make?"

01:24:44.465 --> 01:24:47.258
"Who knew."

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.799
"There would be a storm."

01:24:50.174 --> 01:24:55.133
"How will you extinguish the fire?"

01:24:55.917 --> 01:25:00.966
"Love asks me for a reason.."
- Yes!

01:25:01.549 --> 01:25:06.465
"You're my courage."

01:25:06.585 --> 01:25:08.549
Yes!

01:25:18.174 --> 01:25:20.049
Yes!

01:26:06.341 --> 01:26:09.216
"This is a spark."

01:26:09.674 --> 01:26:12.382
"Who will it burn?"

01:26:12.549 --> 01:26:13.632
Sir?

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:19.966
Hello?

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:22.381
Who's this?

01:26:24.591 --> 01:26:25.966
What happened to Charles?

01:26:27.497 --> 01:26:28.591
What?

01:26:29.799 --> 01:26:31.174
Which hospital?

01:26:55.216 --> 01:26:56.674
Where to, ma'am?

01:26:58.365 --> 01:27:01.721
Hello? Yes, I'm just downstairs.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.216
I'm coming up.

01:27:03.341 --> 01:27:06.008
Ma'am, who do you want to meet?
- Yes.

01:27:07.465 --> 01:27:08.966
Yes?
- Who do you want to meet?

01:27:09.091 --> 01:27:12.262
Mukesh Chabbra, 20-C. I'm coming.
- I see.

01:27:12.382 --> 01:27:14.008
Ma'am, your name?
- Mrs Mathur.

01:27:14.133 --> 01:27:15.216
Fine, go.
- Thank you.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.536
What's wrong with him?

01:27:29.656 --> 01:27:30.906
It's a case of poisoning, sir.

01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:34.156
I never took my eyes off him, sir.

01:27:36.156 --> 01:27:37.365
What's the poison?

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:44.739
It's cyanide, sir.

01:27:45.198 --> 01:27:48.697
Made from apple seeds.
- Apple seeds?

01:27:48.823 --> 01:27:50.406
Wait.

01:27:51.115 --> 01:27:53.613
Reports say that Apple seeds
contain cyanide.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.365
It only takes 1.5 grams
to kill a human.

01:27:56.697 --> 01:27:59.156
And apple seeds contain
0.6 milligrams.

01:28:00.407 --> 01:28:01.864
At the moment he's paralyzed.

01:28:02.397 --> 01:28:04.281
But the doctors are surprised
about how he survived!

01:28:04.948 --> 01:28:06.115
Wait.

01:28:08.989 --> 01:28:11.869
We've found traces of protein
shake and apple seeds

01:28:11.989 --> 01:28:13.864
from his mouth and food pipe.

01:28:14.281 --> 01:28:16.031
Charles.
- Is that what he ate last?

01:28:16.281 --> 01:28:18.613
Yes, sir, and we've also collected
evidence from his home.

01:28:18.781 --> 01:28:20.240
Who did this to you, Charles?

01:28:24.490 --> 01:28:26.739
And...
- I think it's not the father.

01:28:26.966 --> 01:28:28.781
I think someone else is involved.

01:28:30.989 --> 01:28:32.198
I am asking you!

01:28:33.365 --> 01:28:34.744
He can't speak.

01:28:34.864 --> 01:28:36.073
Now!

01:28:37.281 --> 01:28:39.948
"This is a spark."

01:28:40.073 --> 01:28:42.448
"Who will it burn?"

01:28:44.614 --> 01:28:49.240
"The scream hidden in your heart,
who does it call out to?"

01:28:51.115 --> 01:28:52.365
Hello?

01:28:53.492 --> 01:28:54.697
Yes.

01:28:55.731 --> 01:28:56.948
Fire?

01:29:00.823 --> 01:29:02.953
You should've checked first.
- Even I heard the alarm, sir.

01:29:03.073 --> 01:29:04.739
Look the police are here.

01:29:06.281 --> 01:29:07.869
What's wrong?
- It was a false alarm, sir.

01:29:07.989 --> 01:29:09.823
We checked the entire building.
There's no fire anywhere.

01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:14.613
That was a close shave, mister.

01:29:15.122 --> 01:29:17.573
Mom and dad would've killed me.

01:29:18.613 --> 01:29:20.406
You can go. There's no fire, sir.

01:29:20.526 --> 01:29:22.864
We'll put it out even
if there is no fire.

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.115
Let's go upstairs.

01:29:26.192 --> 01:29:27.613
Rashid.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:27.733 --> 01:29:30.656
Find out what set off the alarm.
- Okay, sir.

01:29:31.864 --> 01:29:33.995
Check everything.
Bedroom and kitchen too.

01:29:34.115 --> 01:29:36.697
You wasted your time once before,
and you're doing it again.

01:29:36.949 --> 01:29:38.823
What are you looking for?

01:29:39.198 --> 01:29:40.120
I said it's a false alarm.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.532
Are you looking for
a buried treasure?

01:29:41.948 --> 01:29:44.532
Go find the one who poisoned
my cousin... - Shut up!

01:29:45.503 --> 01:29:47.781
Otherwise, I'll throw you
out of the window.

01:29:51.197 --> 01:29:54.532
It's just the bathroom.
- Nature calls the police too.

01:30:00.523 --> 01:30:02.281
So this is what was going on here.

01:30:02.823 --> 01:30:03.948
Search properly, Rashid.

01:30:04.102 --> 01:30:05.328
I want all his drugs
in front of me.

01:30:05.448 --> 01:30:06.540
Yes, sir.
- Sir, this isn't mine.

01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.073
My dad sometimes...

01:30:08.193 --> 01:30:10.490
Sir, look.
- Sorry sir.

01:30:25.463 --> 01:30:26.864
Honestly, sir, this isn't mine.

01:30:40.739 --> 01:30:44.115
Where did it come from?
- Cyanide was made here.

01:31:05.107 --> 01:31:08.240
Enough to kill an elephant.
- What are you saying, sir?

01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:10.906
Where were you last night?

01:31:11.989 --> 01:31:14.864
At home, sir. Darn it!

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.614
Isn't this your laptop?

01:31:16.823 --> 01:31:18.739
Yeah...
- Look at this, sir.

01:31:27.031 --> 01:31:29.073
Jesus Christ.

01:31:29.887 --> 01:31:32.948
He researched last night.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:40.532 --> 01:31:43.989
Son of a gun! It's been ages
since we had such a solid case.

01:31:45.646 --> 01:31:48.156
Take all this into evidence.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:53.823 --> 01:31:56.406
Arrest him.
- Come on.

01:31:56.697 --> 01:31:58.864
Wait! What for?

01:31:59.179 --> 01:32:02.490
Attempt to murder.
- He's my cousin, like a brother!

01:32:02.902 --> 01:32:04.613
Why would I murder him?

01:32:04.739 --> 01:32:07.094
Maybe you were scared that one of
you might turn a state witness.

01:32:07.214 --> 01:32:08.323
Come on.

01:32:08.448 --> 01:32:10.203
Please.
- Come on.

01:32:10.323 --> 01:32:13.545
You know I haven't done anything.
- Come on!

01:33:25.989 --> 01:33:27.323
Arya...

01:33:30.614 --> 01:33:32.864
Arya, my dear, are you okay?

01:33:52.656 --> 01:33:53.948
Dear...

01:34:23.198 --> 01:34:25.073
Sorry.

01:34:41.852 --> 01:34:44.613
He was my best student.

01:34:48.938 --> 01:34:51.697
How did this happen, Charles?

01:34:53.558 --> 01:34:55.198
How?

01:34:57.539 --> 01:34:59.240
How did it happen?

01:35:02.948 --> 01:35:05.906
"This is a spark."

01:35:06.026 --> 01:35:09.073
"Who will it burn?"

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.240
What happened
to my daughter that night

01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:21.906
happens every night.

01:35:23.997 --> 01:35:25.587
After today,

01:35:26.062 --> 01:35:28.948
even you will never
forget that night.

01:35:33.563 --> 01:35:36.823
You will think about
that night every day

01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:40.697
and regret it.

01:35:47.095 --> 01:35:49.532
What were you guys
screaming that night?

01:35:53.323 --> 01:35:55.323
'Call your mom.'

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.864
Here's her mom.

01:36:12.656 --> 01:36:14.448
I'll call you back, okay?

01:36:19.444 --> 01:36:21.031
What happened to him?

01:36:23.064 --> 01:36:23.864
What happened?

01:36:23.989 --> 01:36:26.115
He got emotional seeing me.
- Are you okay?

01:36:29.948 --> 01:36:32.614
I shall leave.
Get well soon, Charles.

01:36:41.156 --> 01:36:46.115
"The dreams shattered."

01:36:52.656 --> 01:36:58.031
"It will be difficult
to be forgiven."

01:37:02.281 --> 01:37:07.490
"It will be difficult
to be forgiven."

01:37:19.613 --> 01:37:23.323
Yes, the meeting's on schedule.
Of course.

01:37:24.323 --> 01:37:26.115
Vinay, please be there on time.

01:37:26.505 --> 01:37:29.613
I'm getting in the car. 15 minutes.

01:37:31.823 --> 01:37:34.989
'Dad, you look handsome today.'

01:37:43.613 --> 01:37:46.115
'Ask for whatever you want.'

01:37:52.202 --> 01:37:57.614
"Let's go somewhere far."

01:37:57.734 --> 01:37:59.494
'I will get the bookings done.
I love you, my dear.'

01:37:59.614 --> 01:38:05.989
"Let's go somewhere far."

01:38:06.656 --> 01:38:08.948
"Let's go somewhere far."

01:38:09.281 --> 01:38:11.406
'I love you too.'

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:26.948
Bye, mom.
- Bye.

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:46.697
Hello, Mrs Sabarwal. How are you?

01:38:47.948 --> 01:38:50.697
What brings you here at the school?

01:38:51.535 --> 01:38:53.281
Is everything okay?

01:38:54.031 --> 01:38:56.613
Of course, I just came to meet you.

01:38:58.239 --> 01:38:59.739
Yes, tell me. What is it?

01:39:00.621 --> 01:39:02.448
I need your signature.

01:39:03.508 --> 01:39:05.490
What for?
- Well...

01:39:06.369 --> 01:39:10.323
The forensic lab wants
to dispose of Arya's samples.

01:39:10.894 --> 01:39:13.823
If you want to get them
examined by your own doctors,

01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:16.406
then this is your last chance.

01:39:18.349 --> 01:39:19.823
Dispose them.

01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:26.613
I need you to sign this.

01:39:27.406 --> 01:39:28.656
Sure.

01:39:31.031 --> 01:39:32.989
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39:34.368 --> 01:39:36.156
Just one second.

01:39:39.198 --> 01:39:42.198
Are you looking for these?

01:39:48.445 --> 01:39:50.406
Do you also

01:39:52.156 --> 01:39:56.613
wear the same kind of glasses?
- Of course not!

01:39:58.281 --> 01:40:00.989
I can see everything clearly.

01:40:16.365 --> 01:40:18.656
Here, your pen.

01:40:24.864 --> 01:40:27.614
The fourth guy, Jagan Singh.

01:40:28.252 --> 01:40:31.532
He's a hard-core criminal.
Very dangerous.

01:40:32.115 --> 01:40:34.864
If I had two daughters,
I would never go after him.

01:40:36.281 --> 01:40:38.490
Why are you telling me?

01:40:39.046 --> 01:40:41.073
Because he's the only one left.

01:40:41.469 --> 01:40:43.639
Believe it or not, but...

01:40:43.759 --> 01:40:46.989
When the court acquits the guilty,
it makes my blood boil.

01:40:47.906 --> 01:40:51.406
I believe you.
- Then believe this too.

01:40:52.325 --> 01:40:55.406
When someone does my work for me,

01:40:56.808 --> 01:40:58.989
that too makes me very angry.

01:41:01.022 --> 01:41:04.156
I must go, I'm getting late.
- You may go, Mrs Sabarwal.

01:41:04.773 --> 01:41:08.864
But the moment I find evidence,
I will arrest you.

01:41:09.432 --> 01:41:11.240
Excuse me.

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:21.573
What's wrong?
You can't believe it either, right?

01:41:22.599 --> 01:41:26.614
Charles can die anytime and then
Mohit will be charged with murder.

01:41:27.436 --> 01:41:29.656
Does Arya know?

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.965
I don't know.

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:35.365
But she told me that she
wanted to go on a holiday.

01:41:36.541 --> 01:41:40.115
That's really great.
- Yes, read the whole thing.

01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:44.490
Lots of work to do.
Bookings are to be done.

01:41:44.613 --> 01:41:45.948
I'll get to work, okay?

01:41:47.614 --> 01:41:49.198
Anand.
- Yes.

01:41:51.656 --> 01:41:55.573
I want to share something...
- You are worried about Arya?

01:41:57.156 --> 01:41:58.115
She's recovering.

01:41:58.532 --> 01:42:00.323
Everything's getting
back to normal.

01:42:00.443 --> 01:42:03.073
We'll have the best
family vacation ever.

01:42:03.437 --> 01:42:06.198
I am so excited, so happy.

01:42:06.318 --> 01:42:07.739
But I...

01:42:09.198 --> 01:42:13.240
This is a new beginning.
It's what we've been waiting for.

01:42:35.925 --> 01:42:40.406
"In this world"

01:42:40.852 --> 01:42:44.582
"people tend to get deceived."

01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:48.957
You sing really well.

01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:55.124
I always wanted to be a singer
like my mother.

01:42:56.124 --> 01:42:58.665
Was she a singer too?
- No.

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:02.539
She also wanted to be one.

01:43:07.704 --> 01:43:09.249
Let's get to the point.

01:43:12.166 --> 01:43:15.629
It'll take some time.
Jagan is missing.

01:43:15.749 --> 01:43:19.041
I even visited his hometown.
His father passed away.

01:43:20.038 --> 01:43:21.540
He didn't show up.

01:43:23.451 --> 01:43:25.832
The police are getting suspicious.

01:43:26.249 --> 01:43:28.082
Please hurry up.

01:43:30.458 --> 01:43:32.665
By the time you return
from your vacations,

01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:35.832
you'll have all the details
about Jagan.

01:43:36.082 --> 01:43:37.915
With the grace of God,
everything will be fine.

01:43:38.041 --> 01:43:39.539
I have my resources.

01:43:49.749 --> 01:43:51.124
Mr DK.

01:43:53.999 --> 01:43:55.499
Thank you.

01:43:58.957 --> 01:44:00.374
Thank you.

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:23.749
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:44:24.207 --> 01:44:25.999
You want me to set you up?

01:44:30.124 --> 01:44:32.416
Hail Lord Shiva.
- Hail Lord Shiva.

01:44:34.082 --> 01:44:35.749
Do you know who I am?

01:44:37.582 --> 01:44:39.291
Who doesn't know you, sir?

01:44:40.499 --> 01:44:42.291
How about a cup of tea?

01:44:45.166 --> 01:44:48.082
No, sir. I have acidity.

01:44:48.874 --> 01:44:52.707
Acidity? The tea served
in my station is quite sweet.

01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:56.207
I also have diabetes.

01:44:56.458 --> 01:44:58.499
Really?
- Yes, sir.

01:45:00.041 --> 01:45:02.707
Then how about some black coffee?

01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:11.957
Then, let's have some tea.
- That's more like it.

01:45:25.721 --> 01:45:27.623
What are you two planning?

01:45:29.406 --> 01:45:30.665
Who, sir?

01:45:44.499 --> 01:45:48.291
Speak up. What was your plan?

01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:53.540
Because what you're doing
is not the solution.

01:45:57.957 --> 01:46:00.499
I'm saying this for your own good.

01:46:01.499 --> 01:46:05.291
What were you telling Devki?
- Devki, who?

01:46:05.874 --> 01:46:10.082
I don't know any Devki, sir.
Swear on Lord Shiva.

01:46:14.332 --> 01:46:15.527
Rashid.

01:46:16.623 --> 01:46:18.046
Rashid, get the stick.
- Stick?

01:46:18.166 --> 01:46:19.166
Yes, sir.

01:46:19.539 --> 01:46:22.832
What for?
What have I done to get punished?

01:46:23.416 --> 01:46:25.915
Who is this, Matthew?
- Mr Rathore, sir!

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:29.665
I am Daya Shankar Kapoor,
but you can call me DK in short.

01:46:29.957 --> 01:46:32.540
I am the best detective in
Dariyaganj area. Tell him.

01:46:32.957 --> 01:46:35.790
Sir, we're investigating
the gang rape case.

01:46:36.265 --> 01:46:39.790
How is he connected?
- I've seen him with Devki.

01:46:40.207 --> 01:46:43.082
These two are definitely planning
something... - Devki?

01:46:44.124 --> 01:46:45.540
The victim's mother?

01:46:46.665 --> 01:46:47.790
Yes, sir.

01:46:48.999 --> 01:46:50.332
Come out for a minute.

01:47:02.539 --> 01:47:05.832
Forgive me, Lord.

01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:08.291
It can't be anyone else, sir.

01:47:09.539 --> 01:47:10.831
What proof do you have?

01:47:10.951 --> 01:47:12.915
I don't have any goddamn proof.

01:47:16.206 --> 01:47:18.332
If the word gets out to the media,

01:47:18.957 --> 01:47:21.166
then we'll be facing
harassment charges.

01:47:22.539 --> 01:47:24.249
I'll be retiring soon.

01:47:24.458 --> 01:47:27.665
I don't want any kind
of stress, Matthew.

01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:30.499
Sir, I just need a few days.
- Let him go.

01:47:30.623 --> 01:47:34.540
Report to my cabin.
I've a more important case for you.

01:47:58.115 --> 01:47:59.850
Forget him.
- You tell me.

01:47:59.970 --> 01:48:00.953
Will you do it?
- Yes, I will.

01:48:01.073 --> 01:48:02.123
I have...

01:48:02.243 --> 01:48:05.906
"This moon and the moonlit night."

01:48:06.223 --> 01:48:12.948
"Listen to my heart's tale."

01:48:14.314 --> 01:48:16.698
Mohit, visiting time.

01:48:16.911 --> 01:48:18.282
Oh no!

01:48:18.471 --> 01:48:19.953
Just ruined all my fun.

01:48:20.073 --> 01:48:22.906
Hey pretty boy, come back soon.

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:25.031
I'm waiting for you.

01:48:29.748 --> 01:48:31.578
He'll have to pay up at any cost.

01:48:31.698 --> 01:48:34.906
I go there every day,
but he doesn't relent.

01:48:35.026 --> 01:48:37.490
Have the other guys paid up?
- Not yet.

01:48:37.615 --> 01:48:38.942
Jagan, you?

01:48:39.062 --> 01:48:41.365
What's wrong with you?

01:48:41.490 --> 01:48:43.906
I'll meet you
after you get released.

01:48:47.124 --> 01:48:49.282
What's wrong with you?
Why are you walking like that?

01:48:49.821 --> 01:48:51.365
Nothing.
- What?

01:48:51.485 --> 01:48:52.656
It's nothing.

01:48:53.823 --> 01:48:55.198
Sorry.

01:48:56.501 --> 01:49:00.282
Jagan, please get me out of here.

01:49:00.842 --> 01:49:02.574
Find out who's behind all this.
- Shut up!

01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:05.781
First, you poisoned Charles,

01:49:05.906 --> 01:49:07.512
and now you're begging me for help.

01:49:07.632 --> 01:49:10.541
Why would I poison him
when everything was going fine?

01:49:10.865 --> 01:49:11.870
He's my cousin.

01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:13.454
I've never sliced
an apple in my life.

01:49:13.574 --> 01:49:14.990
How can I make cyanide?

01:49:15.152 --> 01:49:16.865
Think about it.

01:49:18.293 --> 01:49:21.073
I've given this some thought.

01:49:22.929 --> 01:49:25.948
Someone's trying
to frame all of us.

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.407
And you're their next target.

01:49:36.615 --> 01:49:38.781
Where are you going? Jagan!

01:49:39.094 --> 01:49:41.615
Jagan, please get me out of here.

01:49:41.892 --> 01:49:43.157
Jagan!

01:49:43.904 --> 01:49:45.865
Get me out of here, please!

01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.990
Let go!

01:49:47.115 --> 01:49:48.131
Jagan!

01:50:06.363 --> 01:50:07.655
Sir,

01:50:08.187 --> 01:50:10.615
I don't know what to say.

01:50:14.583 --> 01:50:16.502
Whoever did this to you

01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:20.126
won't survive.

01:50:21.293 --> 01:50:23.335
Can you give me a hint?

01:50:31.583 --> 01:50:35.584
Mo...
- What?

01:50:35.751 --> 01:50:37.460
Mo...

01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:42.543
Mo...

01:50:43.583 --> 01:50:46.293
Mo... Mohit?

01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:51.335
Mohit can never do this.
That boy is a dimwit!

01:50:52.085 --> 01:50:54.876
He's only good for taking
a puff and passing out.

01:50:55.918 --> 01:50:59.210
I just met him. He was in pain.

01:51:00.168 --> 01:51:01.502
Yes.

01:51:03.959 --> 01:51:05.376
Tell me something.

01:51:10.834 --> 01:51:12.667
Mo...

01:51:13.043 --> 01:51:14.238
Ma...

01:51:14.543 --> 01:51:16.709
I'll make that person's life
miserable!

01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:26.751
At least, tell me his name.
Who is it?

01:51:36.126 --> 01:51:39.210
Mom.
- Mom?

01:51:39.935 --> 01:51:43.376
Whose mom?

01:51:49.376 --> 01:51:51.584
'Call your mom?'

01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:55.376
'Call your mom?'

01:51:56.824 --> 01:51:58.502
That girl's mother.

01:51:58.834 --> 01:52:00.126
That girl's mom did so much.

01:52:01.651 --> 01:52:04.887
Sir! Girl!

01:52:05.377 --> 01:52:08.709
Nurse! Doctor! Sir!

01:52:21.335 --> 01:52:22.959
Who are you?

01:52:23.376 --> 01:52:24.918
How did you get in?

01:52:25.251 --> 01:52:27.251
Where is Mr Sabarwal?

01:52:27.418 --> 01:52:30.001
He's out of town. But who are you?

01:52:30.335 --> 01:52:31.626
I'm his friend.

01:52:32.085 --> 01:52:33.418
Friend.

01:53:32.293 --> 01:53:34.293
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:53:35.077 --> 01:53:37.251
Hail Lord Shiva.

01:53:45.418 --> 01:53:46.502
Yes, my dear.

01:53:47.008 --> 01:53:50.335
Actually, dear,
I was busy all night.

01:53:50.698 --> 01:53:52.460
Yes, sorry.

01:53:52.907 --> 01:53:54.918
Yes, we'll have lunch together.

01:53:55.038 --> 01:53:58.626
Ask your mom to make
some salad as well. Okay?

01:54:12.376 --> 01:54:14.001
Pick up the phone, ma'am.

01:54:16.752 --> 01:54:18.210
Hello?

01:54:20.288 --> 01:54:21.460
Hello?

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:37.667
Hello. - Hurry up, mom.
Arya and dad are waiting, come on.

01:54:37.793 --> 01:54:39.709
Hurry up.
- Hello?

01:54:42.237 --> 01:54:43.918
Tell me, Sherlock.

01:54:44.918 --> 01:54:47.293
You have been following me
from the teacher's house.

01:54:47.751 --> 01:54:49.460
You've been making
a number of calls.

01:54:50.765 --> 01:54:52.834
Who are you? What do you want?

01:54:53.454 --> 01:54:56.126
School teacher.
- School teacher?

01:54:57.251 --> 01:55:00.583
Then go and look in a school.
This is my office.

01:55:11.584 --> 01:55:13.210
You hit me hard.

01:55:14.583 --> 01:55:16.502
Where I come from,

01:55:17.626 --> 01:55:19.547
no one gets a second chance.

01:55:19.667 --> 01:55:22.423
I don't care where you come
from or where you go.

01:55:22.543 --> 01:55:25.876
We'll soon find out.
Now, do you know?

01:55:34.251 --> 01:55:36.793
What's the password, sir?

01:55:38.126 --> 01:55:39.751
Give me your thumb.

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:44.667
You're invading
my personal documents.

01:55:44.955 --> 01:55:47.376
I'll have you arrested
under section 378... - Quiet.

01:55:48.584 --> 01:55:50.085
I won't stay quiet.

01:55:50.648 --> 01:55:52.001
You remember that.

01:56:02.583 --> 01:56:04.335
Hello, Johnson Cottage.

01:56:04.584 --> 01:56:06.001
Can I speak to Mrs Sabarwal?

01:56:06.121 --> 01:56:08.584
'They went out on sightseeing.'

01:56:08.959 --> 01:56:10.168
Thank you.

01:56:11.959 --> 01:56:13.460
Johnson Cottage?

01:56:15.232 --> 01:56:16.667
That's where she is staying, right?

01:56:27.129 --> 01:56:30.918
Now that you know, take my advice.

01:56:31.698 --> 01:56:33.001
Surrender yourself.

01:56:33.264 --> 01:56:35.251
I am not the kind of man

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.756
that gets intimidated by a woman.

01:56:37.876 --> 01:56:39.001
Man?

01:56:39.713 --> 01:56:41.293
You think you're a man?

01:56:41.918 --> 01:56:44.335
Men don't rape, you swine!

01:56:44.876 --> 01:56:48.126
Yes, dino-swine.

01:56:48.939 --> 01:56:50.376
Dino-swine?

01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:55.834
You idiot, it's not dino-swine.

01:56:56.001 --> 01:56:57.547
It's a dinosaur.

01:56:57.667 --> 01:57:00.631
You're going to die
at the hands of that teacher.

01:57:00.751 --> 01:57:02.834
You should learn...

01:57:04.834 --> 01:57:08.293
Learn some English before you die.
Say it, dinosaur...

01:57:09.404 --> 01:57:11.834
Say it, dinosaur.

01:57:11.959 --> 01:57:13.376
Say dinosaur.

01:57:57.834 --> 01:58:01.584
'I have a daughter, she's
the same age as your daughter.'

01:58:02.101 --> 01:58:06.126
'I can feel what you're feeling.'

01:58:14.024 --> 01:58:20.251
"The sun has spread its arms"

01:58:21.091 --> 01:58:27.085
"and opened new paths."

01:58:28.085 --> 01:58:34.543
"May the light reflect
on your lips."

01:58:34.876 --> 01:58:40.251
"And you inch closer to your joys."

01:58:41.543 --> 01:58:47.834
"O sweetheart, for your happiness,"

01:58:49.251 --> 01:58:55.460
"the candles burn all day."

01:58:55.667 --> 01:59:02.251
"O sweetheart, for you,"

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:09.626
"even the angels pray."

01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:24.793
"As you take one step
ahead at a time,"

01:59:25.626 --> 01:59:32.584
"the void gets filled."

01:59:32.704 --> 01:59:38.834
"And you welcome new life
with open arms."

01:59:40.001 --> 01:59:47.006
"With the dreams
filled in your eyes."

01:59:47.126 --> 01:59:53.834
"O sweetheart, for you,"

01:59:54.584 --> 02:00:01.085
"I wish to erase every regret."

02:00:01.293 --> 02:00:07.793
"O sweetheart, for your happiness,"

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:15.543
"the candles burn all day."

02:00:31.418 --> 02:00:38.251
"I never let tears
trickle down my chin."

02:00:38.502 --> 02:00:44.751
"We'll usher
in a new world of joy."

02:00:45.251 --> 02:00:52.418
"All that one needs to live."

02:00:52.543 --> 02:00:59.168
"That's you and me."

02:00:59.834 --> 02:01:05.959
"O sweetheart, for your happiness,"

02:01:07.543 --> 02:01:13.709
"the candles burn all day."

02:01:13.876 --> 02:01:20.251
"O sweetheart, for you,"

02:01:21.626 --> 02:01:29.626
"even the angels pray."

02:01:47.751 --> 02:01:51.168
Sir, DK's family.
Wife and daughter.

02:01:53.392 --> 02:01:55.001
Dad!

02:01:59.376 --> 02:02:01.335
It's been approximately 2 hours.

02:02:02.892 --> 02:02:04.293
Any clue?
- No, sir.

02:02:04.418 --> 02:02:07.210
Even the CCTV footage
has been destroyed.

02:02:07.523 --> 02:02:09.335
Keep looking.
- Yes, sir.

02:03:36.626 --> 02:03:39.418
'If you've to choose
between wrong and very wrong,'

02:03:39.543 --> 02:03:41.001
'then what will you choose?'

02:03:44.043 --> 02:03:45.210
'It's a pen drive.'

02:03:45.584 --> 02:03:47.839
'The police are
getting suspicious.'

02:03:47.959 --> 02:03:49.793
'Hurry up.'

02:03:51.502 --> 02:03:53.085
'Johnson Cottage.'

02:03:53.210 --> 02:03:55.168
'That's where she is
staying, right?'

02:04:22.918 --> 02:04:26.210
Anand, I'll put Piyu to bed.

02:04:33.469 --> 02:04:35.251
Are you feeling cold?

02:04:36.085 --> 02:04:37.876
Let me work on a fire.

02:04:42.957 --> 02:04:44.335
Is that better?

02:04:46.667 --> 02:04:48.043
Negi?

02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:50.043
Negi?

02:04:51.251 --> 02:04:53.126
Where is he?

02:04:53.793 --> 02:04:55.543
I'll go and take a look.

02:05:20.834 --> 02:05:23.293
Negi!

02:06:10.667 --> 02:06:12.043
Anand.

02:06:18.043 --> 02:06:19.085
Arya.

02:06:21.212 --> 02:06:22.335
Run, Arya!

02:06:25.667 --> 02:06:27.168
Run, Arya!

02:06:27.584 --> 02:06:28.876
Anand!

02:06:30.376 --> 02:06:31.584
Anand!

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.626
Anand!

02:06:37.709 --> 02:06:38.702
Anand!

02:06:43.418 --> 02:06:44.751
Nobody will come.

02:06:45.043 --> 02:06:47.626
Neither your husband
nor your spy...

02:06:47.746 --> 02:06:49.376
Anand!
- Quite!

02:06:56.025 --> 02:06:58.959
You're just an ordinary school
teacher!

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.362
Arya...

02:08:54.658 --> 02:08:55.616
Arya.

02:08:56.992 --> 02:08:58.409
Arya!

02:09:06.825 --> 02:09:07.950
Arya!

02:09:22.658 --> 02:09:23.574
You!

02:10:12.325 --> 02:10:13.409
What are you doing, Devki?

02:10:16.117 --> 02:10:17.075
Drop the gun!

02:10:18.992 --> 02:10:22.117
How dare he touch my daughter?

02:10:22.424 --> 02:10:25.205
I'm telling you, drop the gun.

02:10:25.325 --> 02:10:28.491
How dare he touch my daughter?

02:10:28.741 --> 02:10:30.371
How dare he!

02:10:30.491 --> 02:10:33.574
I have the evidence, Devki.
He will be punished.

02:10:34.700 --> 02:10:38.574
But if you shoot,
I swear you'll go to jail as well.

02:10:41.063 --> 02:10:44.158
How dare he touch my daughter!

02:10:44.650 --> 02:10:46.658
Think about your family, Devki.

02:10:47.455 --> 02:10:50.075
I'm just coming from the cottage.
Anand is alive.

02:10:51.574 --> 02:10:53.367
The police are taking him
to the hospital.

02:10:54.119 --> 02:10:55.700
Priya's with him.

02:10:56.490 --> 02:10:58.908
Drop the gun.

02:11:09.574 --> 02:11:11.075
It will happen...

02:11:15.283 --> 02:11:16.450
It will happen...

02:11:17.658 --> 02:11:21.658
It will happen again,
and there's nothing you can do.

02:11:23.628 --> 02:11:25.825
There's nothing you can do.

02:11:28.158 --> 02:11:30.490
It will happen again.

02:11:32.491 --> 02:11:35.866
There's nothing you can do.

02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:42.283
If you want to kill him,
then use the right gun.

02:11:47.825 --> 02:11:49.063
What are you doing?

02:11:49.982 --> 02:11:51.033
This is illegal.

02:11:51.533 --> 02:11:53.872
I am telling you, shoot him!

02:11:53.992 --> 02:11:55.450
I surrender.

02:11:56.450 --> 02:11:58.450
Ma'am, I surrender.

02:12:01.658 --> 02:12:02.866
Please.

02:12:04.658 --> 02:12:06.325
She poisoned my friend.

02:12:06.955 --> 02:12:08.367
She framed Mohit.

02:12:08.908 --> 02:12:10.450
And she castrated Baburam.

02:12:11.367 --> 02:12:12.700
You don't know anything.

02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.200
I know everything.

02:12:15.698 --> 02:12:18.992
Before someone else gets here,
shoot him.

02:12:19.112 --> 02:12:20.825
No, ma'am, please.

02:12:21.451 --> 02:12:23.533
No, please, ma'am.

02:12:25.658 --> 02:12:26.663
I was scared.

02:12:26.783 --> 02:12:29.075
Don't listen to him.
Devki, shoot him.

02:12:29.574 --> 02:12:30.700
I can reform.

02:12:31.242 --> 02:12:32.950
It's now or never.

02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:36.491
Just give me one chance.

02:12:37.158 --> 02:12:38.075
I surrender!

02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:39.705
Shoot him!
- Shut up!

02:12:39.825 --> 02:12:42.325
Give me one chance, I'll reform!

02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:44.325
Pull the damn trigger!

02:13:03.490 --> 02:13:04.533
Mom?

02:13:53.242 --> 02:13:54.409
Mom.

02:14:11.658 --> 02:14:12.574
Mom.

02:14:17.033 --> 02:14:18.616
I love you.

02:14:42.367 --> 02:14:44.200
I love you.

02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:47.700
I love you.

02:14:49.825 --> 02:14:51.325
I love you.

02:15:18.757 --> 02:15:20.577
'Mom'

02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:38.992
Hello.

02:15:44.095 --> 02:15:45.368
Hello.

02:15:50.956 --> 02:15:52.298
Hello.

02:15:56.951 --> 02:15:58.310
Hello.

02:16:09.112 --> 02:16:15.992
"Let's go somewhere far."

02:16:16.491 --> 02:16:23.367
"Let's go somewhere far."

02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:31.367
"Let's go somewhere far."

02:16:42.242 --> 02:16:44.908
"Away from the sorrows."

02:16:45.796 --> 02:16:48.409
"Away from the restlessness."

02:16:49.283 --> 02:16:51.496
"Away from the sorrows."

02:16:51.616 --> 02:16:54.283
"Away from the restlessness."

02:16:54.950 --> 02:17:00.866
"Away from the arduous path
and unnecessary bonding."

02:17:02.117 --> 02:17:06.908
"Away from the people
you don't like."

02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:12.992
"Away from your problems."

02:17:14.783 --> 02:17:20.367
"Let's go somewhere far."

02:17:20.741 --> 02:17:25.242
"Let's go somewhere far."
